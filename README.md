# logo maker
## Description
    
    I want to create a program that takes input from a developer and creates an svg logo using that data in cmd line for quick logos.
    This program allows users the ability to make a logo from commmand line without having to make the logo themselves or hire a designer.
    I learned OOP, jest, aswell as how to work with node.js.
